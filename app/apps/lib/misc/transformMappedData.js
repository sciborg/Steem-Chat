/**
 * Transforms a `data` source object to another object,
 * essentially applying a to -> from mapping provided by
 * `map`. It does not mutate the `data` object.
 *
 * It also inserts in the `transformedObject` a new property
 * called `_unmappedProperties_` which contains properties from
 * the original `data` that have not been mapped to its transformed
 * counterpart. E.g.:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const data = { _id: 'abcde123456', size: 10 };
 * const map = { id: '_id' }
 *
 * transformMappedData(data, map);
 * // { id: 'abcde123456', _unmappedProperties_: { size: 10 } }
 * ```
 *
 * In order to compute the unmapped properties, this function will
 * ignore any property on `data` that has been named on the "from" part
 * of the `map`, and will consider properties not mentioned as unmapped.
 *
 * You can also define the "from" part as a function, so you can derive a
 * new value for your property from the original `data`. This function will
 * receive a copy of the original `data` for it to calculate the value
 * for its "to" field. Please note that in this case `transformMappedData`
 * will not be able to determine the source field from your map, so it won't
 * ignore any field you've used to derive your new value. For that, you're
 * going to need to delete the value from the received parameter. E.g:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const data = { _id: 'abcde123456', size: 10 };
 *
 * // It will look like the `size` property is not mapped
 * const map = {
 *     id: '_id',
 *     newSize: (data) => data.size + 10
 * };
 *
 * transformMappedData(data, map);
 * // { id: 'abcde123456', newSize: 20, _unmappedProperties_: { size: 10 } }
 *
 * // You need to explicitly remove it from the original `data`
 * const map = {
 *     id: '_id',
 *     newSize: (data) => {
 *         const result = data.size + 10;
 *         delete data.size;
 *         return result;
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * transformMappedData(data, map);
 * // { id: 'abcde123456', newSize: 20, _unmappedProperties_: {} }
 * ```
 *
 * @param Object data The data to be transformed
 * @param Object map The map with transformations to be applied
 *
 * @returns Object The data after transformations have been applied
